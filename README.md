# Bezier-Spline-Project

The project contains a couple of programs that I created during an optional course at my faculty entitled "Applications of Geometry in Computer Science".
I had expected the course to be about things like raytracing or using voronoi cells for wall shattering, but instead the course focused on curves and surfaces in computer graphics.

The programs could use a bit of sharpening of its rough edges, but for now the project is closed as I am currenty focused on other projects.
